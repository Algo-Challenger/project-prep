# Software Requirements

## What is the vision of this product?

We want to develop an application that lets users complete code challenges and can view stats of code challenges that they have completed.

## What pain point does this project solve?

There are times when you can encounter an issue with syntax or functionality. with this app, we want to provide more experience in solving common issues that you may find either in your school or at your job.

## Why should we care about your product?

This gives students and self taught learners another way to challenge themselves through common code.

## Scope (In/Out)

- In - What will your product do?
  - Describe the individual feature
  - High overview of each:

    - Login with google
    - See a generated list of random code challenges
    - Can choose which code that they would like to work on and enter my solution
    - A submit button that allows user to run their code

- OUT - What will your product NOT do.
  - Our Product WILL NOT:

    - Have a bunch of bugs
    - Work with languages other than JavaScript
    - Let you create your own tests.
    - Show the user the correct answers

## What will your MVP functionality be?

- Users can see a generated list of random code challenges grabbed from a code - API, this API allows user to run their code

- Users can choose which code that they would like to work on, save their choice (favorites Icon), and delete their previous saves. Users can have a stats profile with a summary of their accomplisment: “insert name ” Has completed “insert number of” challenges

- Users can also delete their currently saved challenges.
At least have the user be able to receive a pass or test.

## What are your stretch goals?

- Leaderboards of all the scores
- User can see their score after their results
- Difficulty settings
- Sharing the users profile with others

## Functional Requirements

- User can login with google
- User can see a generated list of random code challenges
- User can choose which code that they would like to work on and enter their solution
- User can have a submit button that allows user to run their code

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Scalability through the profile data base
- Maintainability through a componentized front end
