## Project Idea 1: Code Challenge App (JavaScript)

### Summary-

An app that lets Users complete code challenges and can view stats of code challenges that they have completed.

### Problem-

Allows developers to practice their coding skills.

### MVP-

Users can see a generated list of random code challenges grabbed from a code - API, this API allows user to run their code
Users can choose which code that they would like to work on, save their choice (favorites Icon), and delete their previous saves. Users can have a stats profile with a summary of their accomplisment: “insert name ” Has completed “insert number of” challenges
Users can also delete their currently saved challenges.
At least have the user be able to receive a pass or test.

## Project Idea 2: Condensed Topic Search

### Summary

An app that allows the users to see a brief summary of any topic that is available on wikipedia.

### Problem

Provides direct and distraction-free summaries of desired topics

### MVP

Users will enter their topic and a condensed version of the topic’s information is rendered back.
Gives users the option to either add recent searches, and/or view recent searches and delete them is needed. Can add their own notes for update. If possible, User can see multiple tags (Accordions? Maybe with Material UI) that they can click on to show the information on each category of that topic.
